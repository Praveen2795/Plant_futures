## Author of this code and respective readme file:

## Objective:
The main goal of this code is to analyse the "Luciferase-Pruebas" plant images. This code crunches a dataset containing 378 usable images to cluster them into different groups. The raw images are of size 2832X 4240 and are colored. 

## Resources used in Architecture:
Since the goal of this project is to establish communication between plants, AI and human beings using images, the main software packages revolve around computer vision and some code to handle the sound messages. Googleâ€™s drive and Colab were used for most of the experimentation workloads, modeling and testing. The list of software frameworks and resources used for storage, compute, data preprocessing and modeling are shown in table below.

## About the Data:
A high resolution DSLR camera was used to capture around 500 HD bioluminescent images. The camera was configured using Pythonâ€™s PTP library (code not included) to automatically capture time lapse photographs and were stored in a local machine to be imported into Google Drive. The usable raw images were selected after a manual screening and cleaning procedures. The filtered images were stored in google drive and later were imported to the Cobal environment as a zip file. Since the number of images was not so big, we chose Google Drive for our operations.

## Getting started

### Installation

#### Python and Jypter notebook
If you have not installed Python 3.9 already, the easiest method to install both the programs is by installing [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) The following link provides a graphical installer link for both Windows and Mac OS [Link](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

If you have already installed Python 3.9 and are an advanced user, you can install Jypter Notebook on terminal by following the steps below.

	pip3 install jupyter	

### Setting Up Local Environment
Navigate to file on google colab and click the download button in found in the dropdown, then click download as .ipynb file to the respective directory where you want to this notebook to be saved in your machine. <br/>

### Running Environments

#### Jypter notebook

If you have installed the Jypter notebook via anaconda, you can run the notebook directly by double clicking on the Jypter notebook icon on the start menu on Windows or Mac, going to the app drawer and selecting the Jypter notebook.

If you have installed Jypter notebook via Python, you can go to Terminal and type the following code:
 
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

Both the processes will open up the Jypter notebook environment in a default web browser.Â 

In the application window, there will be a file explorer. Navigate to the respective folder where you have cloned the project and select the **" ClusterPruebas.ipynb "** to load up the notebook. 

#### Google colab

If you want to run this project on Google Colab, Navigate to the following [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qIdsA2dlP0R0bp2cDoQY-CYo0-5tA3kN?authuser=1#scrollTo=nh8qtDZijLqq). Please use this [data link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AaWdXBl30SXSVFS93YPT0BUPvs7eXwwn/view?usp=share_link) to downlaod the zipped dataset and upload it into your google drive account. When you are running the code in your google colab, your drive has to be mounted using the below link to access the dataset that you have uploaded. 

   ```
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```
After mounting your google drive, you should be able to locate the path of the dataset in your drive and use the below code to unzip the file.
   ```
   import zipfile
   local_zip = '/path.zip'
   zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile(local_zip, 'r')
   zip_ref.extractall()
   zip_ref.close()
  ```
